    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup salted butter, softened</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsweetened triple chocolate baking cocoa</li>
      <li>
        1 large dark chocolate bar, chopped into chunks (about 1 cup chunks)
      </li>
      <li>1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon confectioners sugar (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Direction</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees
        C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat butter and sugar together in a bowl with an electric mixer until
        creamy. Beat in vanilla. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating in each egg
        completely before adding the next.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in flour and cocoa powder until fully combined. Stir in chocolate
        chunks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread mixture into prepared pan, then pour pie filling over the top,
        smoothing it out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes, then check for doneness. A
        toothpick inserted near the center should come out with just a few moist
        crumbs. Bake up to 10 minutes more, if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cool completely; sprinkle with confectionerâ€™s sugar. Cut into bars.
      </li>
    </ol>
