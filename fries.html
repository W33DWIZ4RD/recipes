    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Air Fryer Sriracha Fries are crispy, spicy, and delicious French fries
      cooked in an air fryer, offering a healthier alternative to deep-fried
      fries. They are made with fresh potatoes, tossed in oil and Sriracha, and
      air fried to golden perfection.
